From Block12's simple premise flow hours of careful planning and hypnotic strategy. Only the sharpest minds can make it to level 12...

Block12 has one rule -- match your row to any row in the grid. Doing so successfully, though, will require strategy, foresight, and spatial reasoning. With each level the challenge becomes greater. 

Block12 takes seconds to learn, but none has mastered it yet. 

Features: 

  - Game-changing powerups that reveal themselves level by level
  - A moody, hypnotic original soundtrack
  - No ads -- none, ever
